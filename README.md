Habit Tracker is a command-line application that helps users track and analyze their habits. It was developed in the Ubuntu environment locally and pushed to GitHub only after it was successfully tested.
### Features
- Add Habit: Users can add a new habit to the tracker. Each habit has a name and a period (daily or weekly).
- Remove Habit: Users can remove an existing habit from the tracker.
- Complete Habit: Users can mark a habit as completed for the day.
- List Habits by Periodicity: Users can view all their habits, grouped by periodicity (daily or weekly).
- View Streaks: Users can view their streaks for each habit. A streak is a consecutive period of time where the user completed the habit.
- Find Struggling Habit: The application identifies the habit with the lowest average streak length, helping users identify habits they might be struggling with.
